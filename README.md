# Book-Recommendation-System
Book Recommender System – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Book Recommendation dataset that includes information about books, users, and ratings.
The aim is to explore patterns in user preferences, rating behaviors, and book popularity, which serve as the foundation for building a Book Recommender System.

🔍 Objectives

Explore how users rate books across different age groups and regions.

Identify popular authors, publishers, and genres.

Analyze rating distributions and identify biases.

Understand the relationships between user demographics and reading preferences.

Generate insights that can help in building collaborative and content-based recommendation models.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy (data handling)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)

Jupyter Notebook (analysis environment)

📊 Key Insights

Certain authors and publishers dominate the top-rated books.

Most users rate only a small number of books, while a few rate many.

Ratings show skewness, with more positive ratings than negative ones.

Younger users tend to engage with popular fiction, while older age groups prefer niche or academic titles.
